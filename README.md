# LeetCode / DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems as part of a 90-day structured practice challenge.  
The goal of this challenge is to improve problem-solving skills and coding efficiency.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- Solve DSA problems consistently over a 90-day period.  
- Focus on a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems to gradually increase problem-solving ability.  
- Maintain clean, well-documented Python codew.  
- Include quick test cases in each problem file for local verification.

## ðŸ“† Challenge Structure

- Duration: 90 days  
- Daily Target: Solve 2-3 problems per day (depending on difficulty)  

- **Problem Division:**
  - **Days 1â€“30 â†’ Easy problems**  
    Focus on arrays, linked lists, stacks, and strings to build strong fundamentals.  
  - **Days 31â€“60 â†’ Medium problems**  
    Includes arrays, strings, linked lists, graphs, and dynamic programming to improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
  - **Days 61â€“90 â†’ Hard problems**  
    Covers advanced topics in linked lists, graphs, dynamic programming, and combinations to prepare for tough coding challenges.
